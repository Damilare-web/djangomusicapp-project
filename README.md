# djangomusicapp-project
This is my work on using Django to create a music app project.
i created a Django project named “songcrud” and created an app in the project called “musicapp”. my project contains a requirements.txt file housing all the pinned dependencies from my project.

Note: Always create a virtual environment anytime you're working on a new Django project. You can get your requirements.txt file from your virtual environment
